### Known issues

- The auth screen appears more often that desired. Sometimes the plugin don't load correctly, but you can click other plugin on your SD configuration or restart it to fix it (working on an improvement)

- The translations are set for English, Spanish, French and German, but the Property inspector is only showing the english version (needs review)
